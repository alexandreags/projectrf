		<p>Project RF:  Unified Audit Reporting Framework</p>
		<p>This project is designed to be a unified reporting framework <br>
		for the open source and commercial penetration testing tools <br>
		used by auditors (and me...mostly me).</p>
		<p>As time moves forward I can add additional report frameworks as time permits.  Requests are always welcome!</p>
		<p>For tutorials on how to use some of the features see the project wiki at <a href="https://github.com/jamesedgejr/projectrf">https://github.com/jamesedgejr/projectrf</a></p>
