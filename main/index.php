		<p>Project RF:  Unified Audit Reporting Framework</p>
		<p>This project is designed to be a unified reporting framework <br>
		for the open source and commercial penetration testing tools <br>
		used by auditors (and me...mostly me).</p>
		<p>As time moves forward I can add additional report frameworks as time permits.  Requests are always welcome! projectrf@jedge.com</p>
		<p>I'm currently working on securing all the crappy code I wrote over ten years ago.  Stable-Version should be secure from all input validation.</p>
		<p>All functions should work as I use them myself.</p>
		<p>For tutorials on how to use some of the features see the project wiki at <a href="https://github.com/jamesedgejr/projectrf">https://github.com/jamesedgejr/projectrf</a></p>
